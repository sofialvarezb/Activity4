#Activity 4

2. Addition of elements: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input
and return the sum of all the elements of the list.

3. Average of values: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as
input and calculate the average of all the elements of the list.
4. Dedupe: Write a function that takes a list as input and
remove all duplicate items, leaving only one occurrence of each item
in the final list.
5. Sort List: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and
order from smallest to largest. Don't use Python's built-in sort function.
tuples
6. Longest Words: Write a function that takes a list of words as
input and return the longest word in the list. If there are several words with the same
maximum length, returns the first one that appears in the list.
7. Product of elements: Write a function that takes a tuple of numbers as
input and return the product of all elements in the tuple.
8. Greatest and least element: Write a function that takes a tuple of numbers as
input and return the maximum and minimum value of the tuple.
9. Count Occurrences: Write a function that takes a tuple as input and counts
how many times each element appears in the tuple, returning a dictionary with the
elements as keys and occurrences as values.
10.Find Indices: Write a function that takes a tuple and an element as input, and
return a list with all the indices in which the element appears in the tuple.
11.Separate elements: Write a function that takes a tuple of strings as input
and return two separate tuples: one with all strings starting with a
vowel and another with those that are not.
DICTIONARIES
1. Word Count: Write a function that takes a list of words as input and
return a dictionary that counts how many times each word appears in the list.
2. Calculate GPA: Write a function that takes a dictionary of
students and their grades as input, and calculate the grade point average
of all students.

3. Filter by value: Write a function that takes a dictionary and a value as input,
and return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs of the
original dictionary whose value is equal to the given value.
4. Combine Dictionaries: Write a function that takes two dictionaries as input and
combine them into one, adding the values of the keys that are common in
both dictionaries.
5. Most frequent words: Write a function that takes a text as input and
return a dictionary that counts how many times each word occurs in the text,
ignoring case (case sensitive).
